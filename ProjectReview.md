## Final Project Review


### Project Experience 
This project was a good learning experience.

### Code and Architecture Walk-Through / Product Demonstration

### What did you do right?
Most funcations work at acceptable rate.

### What did you do wrong?
I spent to much time on unnessary functions. 
Project has no test cases.
Project has very little material, left errors in some functions and much of the user interface default.

### Where were you lucky?
Using a calendar plugin made many actions simple to implement.

### What would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?
I repeatedly had to recreate the database, when originally designing it I did not understand the project requirements.
